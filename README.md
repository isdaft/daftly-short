nodejs-url-shortener
=====================


A simple URL shortener built with Node.js

Live demo!

This is running on my free tier Cloudbees account, so if the link above doesn't work try again in 5 minutes as it will be waking from hibernation.


Improvements needed
---------
 - Make use of the environment specific configuration for port/hostnames.
 - Obtain a shorter base URL!
 - Add a "copy to clipboard" button.
 - Consider persisting the short codes to a datastore.
